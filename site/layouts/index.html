      <h1>Question 2</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">What is your favorite thing about providing technical support?</h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">My favorite thing about providing technical support is the process of figuring out the root of a problem and working towards finding the solution from there, then giving that solution to the person who is having the problem. Not only do I love getting a problem solved, but I also love knowing that I made a positive difference in somebody’s day.</p>

      <h1>Question 3</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">What did you think of our service during the time you used it?  Provide either some constructive criticism or some points that impressed you.  Be honest!  “It sucked” isn’t a wrong answer unless you don’t elaborate and provide some constructive criticism ;)</h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">I really like Netlify! As you’ll see in my answer below, one of the challenges I faced during this exercise was getting a bit more familiar with how GitHub works (since I’ve mainly used SourceTree for my work), however once I had a better understanding of how it’s all integrated I found that Netlify is a pretty easy tool to use! The continuous deployment makes committing changes SO much easier, as it takes absolutely no time at all to see the work you put in go live on the site. <br />
One piece of constructive criticism I have is to offer the option to refresh deployment next to the Site Settings and Domain Settings buttons on the Overview page. I did find that I always had to refresh the entire page every time I wanted a new build to appear, so having a button there that the user can click might make it that much faster. However, maybe I still haven’t fully grasped how the continuous deployment works and there’s a button elsewhere that I’m missing. Otherwise, I found it to be really easy and the fact that it’s just a quick three step process makes it all the much better!

      <h1>Question 4</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Talk about how you made your site and why you chose the tools you did. Briefly explain a challenge you experienced in setting up this site and how you solved it.</h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">I created my site by using the Hugo template listed on the provided StaticGen link in the exercise. I then attempted to create the landing page myself, but was not pleased with the way it looked so I took a template from a website I use often: w3schools. I implemented the Start Page CSS Template that they provided into the index.html file in the Site -> Layouts folder, then switched out the text to represent the questions asked in the exercise and the answers I provided (and removed the icons they had on that template). It still doesn’t look exactly how I would like, but it’s vastly better than it was originally! <br />
In all honesty, I never really knew how to build a website as I was always testing on sites that were already built (or I would create websites via a CMS site like WordPress). Therefore, the biggest challenge I had was getting a better understanding of how a website’s code is stored and which file to change in order to change the landing page. However, I did my research and though I still have a lot to learn, I figured out the most important part for this exercise’s purposes (how to implement my answers).<br />
Another challenge I faced was the aforementioned challenge with GitHub – though I use GitHub through SourceTree at my current job, I haven’t used it as an individual site so learning how to navigate the website was a bit difficult at first, but I think I got the hang of it!

      <h1>Question 5</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Provide a link to documentation for a technical/developer-focused product, which you think are well done, and briefly explain why you think they are well done.</h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">I’ve been using Nightwatch as the end-to-end testing solution for automation tests at my current role and have found the <a href="http://nightwatchjs.org/api">API Reference documentation</a> on their website to be well done. It’s simple and easy to navigate, yet has everything that you would need available in each section. For example, if you click the “Expect” section, all terminologies that use “expect” appear in the sidebar so you can easily see each option, yet you can either click a specific terminology or scroll down through the page to see detailed information on all of the options that use “Expect.” To me, this is invaluable because there are certain terminologies that momentarily slip my mind, so the sidebar lists quickly trigger my memory. However, if I don’t know exactly how to word something, I can easily click on one of the options in the list and learn more about the exact wording.</p>

      <h1>Question 6</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Why do you think SSL/HTTPS is important?</h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">In my opinion, SSL/HTTPS is important for three main reasons: 
      <ul>
<li> Protecting the security and privacy of a website’s users. Ultimately, you do not want to hazard your customer’s personal data, and you cannot guarantee that your site is a safe one to visit without the security that SSL/HTTPS provides. </li>
<li> Ensuring trust between a user and that website. As someone who goes to many different websites daily, there’s something comforting to be said about the little green lock in the URL bar. When customers feel safe on your website, you will have a more loyal following due to the established trust that SSL/HTTPS provides. </li>
<li> Keeping that website as usable/findable as possible. Google has recently confirmed that they favor HTTPS sites, and over 40% of the sites found on the first page of Google are HTTPS. If you want your brand to be high up on the list of Google searches, simply SEO won’t cut it - you’ll want to also have HTTPS on your site.</li>

      <h1>Question 7</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Explain, in a couple of paragraphs, what you think 2 major challenges around DNS configuration are for less-technical internet end-users.</h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">For one, I think less technical users may not even know what DNS configuration is or understand why it is necessary. They may not realize that simply buying a domain name won’t automatically direct their website’s IP address to that domain name. In fact, they may not even realize that each website has its own custom IP address in and of itself! <br />

Along with this, another challenge is that the steps for DNS configuration may be slightly complicated to understand and can vary greatly depending on the host website/where the domain name is registered, so it’s not easy to find one main source of information on how to do DNS configuration. A less technical user may not know how to look up the steps for DNS configuration and may get confused on how to even get started.  </p>

      <p class="w3-text-grey"> Hello Mr. Smith,<br />

                              Thank you for reaching out to us at Netlify! I’m really sorry to hear that your site won’t build, that must be incredibly frustrating for you. I’d love to do anything I can to help! <br />

                              In order for me to get to the bottom of this issue, is there any way that you can tell me exactly what it is that is happening for you? When you say your site won’t build, is there an issue with the initial set-up process, or are you having a hard time getting updates deployed to your site? Any information that you can provide here would be valuable as I want to get this issue fixed as soon as possible. <br />

                              Thank you so much in advance for your time!<br />

                              All the best,<br />
                              Lis Huber | Support Engineer @ Netlify</p>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">Post the test on a custom Netlify page itself! I think it’s a great test, but instead of sending it in an email, it’s easier to access if it’s via a link. Plus then the job candidate can better visualize how to set up his/her site for the exercise.</p>
